## Simpson's Paradox

|           | Solution A        | Solution B        |
| ---       | ---               | ---               |
| Case A    | 90% = 90 / 100    | 80% = 640 / 800   |
| Case B    | 30% = 300 / 900   | 25% = 50 / 200    |
| Total     | 39% = 390 / 1000  | 69% = 690 / 1000  |

Though solution A outperform solution B in both cases, the accuracy of solution A underperforms when combining both cases number.

The reason why this paradox occurs is because:
- The amount of both cases are not equally distributed
- The final accuracy is inclined to the case which gets more amount
- The final accuracy weights more on the predominant case
